The project aims to develop a simple and user-friendly application for sending messages that can only be read once and within a limited time for showing. The product can be useful for communication where it is important to transmit confidential information and be assured that it will be permanently deleted after being read.

The application was implemented using React.js, which ensures fast and uninterrupted interface operation. Additionally, the Tailwind library was used to achieve a modern and appealing design and to improve productivity, including the implementation of a dark theme.

On the server side, Express.js was used to improve the application's performance and ensure optimal interaction with the client side.

As a result of this approach to product development, a good user experience and alignment with the main goals of the project were successfully achieved.
